This mod adds female versions of existing Jokers in Balatro. 
These aren’t just visual changes — each new Joker will have unique abilities or slightly altered effects, designed to fit their style while still staying balanced.

The goal is to expand the roster with more variety and representation, using the existing structure of the game. Right now, the focus is on adding these new Jokers. 
Later updates may include challenges or other changes.

This is still a work in progress. Right now, the mod includes:

Custom Jokers (female versions of existing ones)

Compatibility with any smod version of the game (above 323)

Challenges are planned, but not implemented yet.
